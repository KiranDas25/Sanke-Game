# Sanke-Game

It is a Sanke Game in C++

We can play the game:\
  [ 'a' to move in west direction ]
  , [ 's' to move in south direction ]
  , [ 'w' to move in north direction ]
  , [ 'd' to move in east direction ]
  , [ 'x' to leave the game ]

The length of the sanke increases as the number of fruit he eats

Each time the sanke eats a fruit score increases by 10 

If the sanke hits the boundary or his own body the game ends
